            I was given a Cacti shopping website and I use the theory behind A/B
            testing to determine which version of the website performs better.
            <br /><br />
            I modified version B of the website to change the location of the
            <b class="text-white">Add to Cart</b> button from the right of the
            image to make it inline with the image (just like Amazon does).
            Below I propose my hypotheses, and conduct statistical tests to
            appraise my hypotheses.

                not be statistically significant

              <td>
                <span class="font-italic">H<sub>a</sub> :</span>
                The time to completion rate will be less for version B because
                of the change to the layout of the Add to Cart button from the
                side to inline with the image
              </td>
              <td>
                <span class="font-italic">H<sub>a</sub> :</span>
                Version A and B will have different return rate and this can be
                attributed to the change to the layout of where the
                <b>Add to Cart</b> button is placed along with the number of
                items in the cart, making it more user friendly and less
                confusing.

          As seen above, the reason for my choosing my hypotheses is line with
          the changes that I made to version B of the website. Version B has the
          <b>Add to Cart</b> button and the number of items in the cart in line
          with the image of the product, hoping that this would be more
          intuitive and user friendly to use.

          Takeaways and Conclusions
        </h2>
        <p class="text-white">
          I have a couple of points to note with regard to the results received
          in conducting this experiment which I note below:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item bg-color-bg text-white">
            Something to consider is a lot of users when generating traffic for
            other people's websites, seemed to buffer the tabs. When the tabs
            load, the session ID is generated, which is why I think some of my
            results displayed a couple of outliers with respect to how much time
            they spent on the website.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item bg-color-bg text-white">
            A lot of users seemed to finish adding to the cart and then returned
            back to the homepage with a different version of the website, most
            likely because they were hard refreshing the tab which resulted in a
            couple of outliers too.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item bg-color-bg text-white">
            I also thought that changing the flow of the document to translate
            the <b>Add to cart</b> button and the number of items in the user's
            cart to inline with the image would have helped with the purposes of
            navigating the page in a quick manner. However, as the p-value spoke
            its truth, this was not the case.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item bg-color-bg text-white">
            Another reason for a p-value that we got indicating that the change
            did not really affect time to completion time is because users were
            looking to <b>Add to Cart</b> as quickly as possible. This
            experiment is not a true, reliable source to check
            <span class="font-italic">actual</span> user data
          </li>
        </ul>
