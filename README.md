# 1300-Portfolio

This repository contains a website that I developed for CS1300 UI/UX that displays the projects
that I worked on in the class.

This will probably be transferred over to my main website [hansbala.com](http://hansbala.com)
in due time cause I really like the dark mode interface and theme.

Overall, I am really happy with this.

# Some Potential Improvements
* Include some kind of navbar as the website gets bigger (will need to do this for my live website)
* Embed each project's website code into this repo that contains one central repository for all
  my code. That way I can just push to this repo, and my changes will all be updated live onto
  my website (probably will look into some CI interface for this)
* Dark-mode everything for all of the sub-websites (with the same minty-terminal theme going around)
